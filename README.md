# thesis-guidelines
Dear DASS Student,

You have registered with me for your MS Thesis, and like you, I look forward to this exciting journey ahead. To make our regular meetings more effective, Iâ€™ve written out all the logistics in a document, which should help you plan your thesis better. In addition to this guidelines document, you will also find an excel sheet to plan your thesis timeline better.

Caution: These guidelines are not entirely TUD regulations, but a structure which comes from my experience. Hence these may not completely apply to other MS students, outside our group.
