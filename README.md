# thesis-guidelines
Dear DASS Student,

You have registered with me for your MS Thesis, and like you, I look forward to this exciting journey ahead. To make our regular meetings more effective, Iâ€™ve written out all the logistics in [ms-thesis-guidelines](ms_thesis_guidelines.pdf), which should help you plan your thesis better. In addition to this guidelines document, you will also find [planning-template](planning_template.xlsx) to plan your thesis timeline better. The use of this planning template is also outlined in the guidelines document.

Caution: These guidelines are not entirely TUD regulations, but a structure which comes from my experience. Hence these may not apply to other MS students, outside our group.
